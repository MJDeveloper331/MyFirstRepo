some Git Commands:

Clone and Status:
Clone: Cloning a repository on oour local machine.
      git clone<-some link->

Status: Displays the status of the code.
       git status

cd: Change directory(directory means folder).
Let suppose we have a folder GitDemo. In this folder, we have another folder MyFirstRepo. So, if we want to go in the folder inside a folder, we use this command.
       cd MyFirstRepo

ls (list files): To see all the files and folders.
       ls

ls -a: To see all the files and folders including hidden ones.
       ls -a

[After modifying the file, we have to follow two steps:
First, we have to add it.
Secondly, we have to commit it.]

[Whenever, we use git status command, we have generally four types of status,
1:Untracked:
New files that git doesn't yet know and track.
2:Modified;
Files that have been changed/ Changes files.
3:Unmodified:
Unchanged Files.
4:Staged:
File is ready to be commited.
(Generally, when do some changes in a file, that file becomes modified. When we add a new file, that becomes untracked.
So, whenever we do changes like in the file or adding a new file, we heve to add the changes.When we add the changes, the file becomes "staged".
Next, we have to commit the changes. After commiting the changes, our file will become unmodified.)

Add and Commit:
add:
Adds new or changed(modified) files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
       git add<-file name->   (to add a specific change and file)
       git add .              (to add all the changes and files)

commit:
It is the record of change/to add in the record.
       git commit-m"some message"   (message should be meaningful like if we have added a new feature, the it should be "Add new button or feature", or if we fixed a bug, then it can be "Fix new bug" or "Fix old bug".
